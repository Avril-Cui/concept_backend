# It's good practice to specify the user. Deno's image provides a non-root 'deno' user.
USER deno

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the port the application will listen on.
# The Requesting concept defaults to PORT 10000.
EXPOSE 10000

# Copy all application files into the working directory.
# CRITICAL FIX: Use --chown to ensure the 'deno' user owns the files.
COPY --chown=deno:deno . .

# NOTE: We do NOT run 'deno task build' here because concepts.ts is manually maintained
# with a custom async init() pattern. The auto-generator would overwrite our carefully
# crafted initialization code and break the deployment.

# Cache the main module and all its dependencies.
# This ensures faster startup times for the container as modules are pre-compiled.
RUN deno cache src/main.ts

# Specify the command to run when the container starts.
# Using 'deno task start' is the best practice here, as it encapsulates
# the full run command and necessary permissions from deno.json.
