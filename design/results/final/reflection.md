# Project Reflection

## Challenges
- Software design effort: The most difficult part of this project was the software design process. I spent significant time on Assignment 1 (developing a strong project idea) and Assignment 4a (ensuring my concepts were modular and well-structured). Each of these required roughly 20 hours of focused design work.
- Balancing abstraction and detail: It was challenging to determine how abstract or specific to make each concept so that later implementation would remain flexible but coherent.

## What Went Well
- Clear design foundation: Once I built a solid conceptual foundation, the coding process became much smoother. The modular design made my implementation phase more intuitive and reduced debugging time.
- Incremental development: I adopted an incremental coding approach, testing and refining components one step at a time. This prevented major integration issues and helped maintain steady progress.

## Mistakes and Lessons Learned
- Overloading LLMs with unnecessary context: At times, I gave Claude or Copilot excessive context, which led to temporary usage limits and slower responses.
- Lesson: Be selective and intentional about the context I provide to LLMs—include only the relevant files or functions related to the current task.

## Skills Gained and Areas for Growth
- Acquired skills: Improved software design thinking, API design, and modular architecture planning. I also became more efficient in integrating backend and frontend through concept-driven development.
- To further develop: I want to deepen my understanding of system scalability, state management, and frontend optimization for more complex apps. I needed AI's help with some of these.

## Use of Tools
- Context Tool: I used it extensively to organize and link my backend concepts and API calls. It provided structure and clarity during development. I like the outputs from these context tools.
- Agentic Coding Tool (Claude): Primarily used for frontend implementation support—helping with syntax, layout adjustments, and quick iterations.

## Role of LLMs in Software Development
- LLMs are powerful efficiency boosters, ideal for accelerating implementation, generating iterative code, and debugging.
- However, strong software design must come from the engineer. A well-designed system ensures that LLM prompts remain clear and that the resulting code is cohesive.
- LLMs amplify productivity, they don’t replace engineers. I think good design and precise communication are what make LLM assistance truly effective.
