# TaskCatalog
## Initial state check
Initially, there is no task for a new user. We just the behavior by ensuring the query `_getUserTasks` returns an error.
```
TaskCatalog Concept Tests ...
  Initial State: _getUserTasks for a new user should return an error ...
------- post-test output -------

--- Initial State Check: _getUserTasks for a new user ---
  _getUserTasks for user:Charlie returned: {"error":"No tasks found for owner: user:Charlie"}
----- post-test output end -----
  Initial State: _getUserTasks for a new user should return an error ... ok (31ms)
  Scenario 1: Operational Principle - Basic Task Lifecycle ...
------- post-test output -------
```
## Scenario 1 — operational principle
We run the following steps:
1. `createTask`
2. `updateTaskCategory`
3. `assignSchedule`
4.	`_getUserTasks` -> expects exactly 1 task, ID matches.
5.	`deleteTask` -> verifies the task is removed from DB.
Result: All steps passed. Test success.
```
