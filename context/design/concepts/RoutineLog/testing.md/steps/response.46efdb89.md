## Fixed Code and Explanation

The compilation errors arise from two main issues:

1. **Missing import for `freshID` in the test file:** The `freshID` utility function was used in `RoutineLog.test.ts` but not imported.
2. **Incorrect type inference for `findOneAndUpdate` results in the concept implementation:** TypeScript was not correctly recognizing the `FindAndModifyResult` type returned by MongoDB's `findOneAndUpdate` method, leading to errors when accessing `result.value`.

I've corrected these issues in both `RoutineLog.ts` and `RoutineLog.test.ts`.
