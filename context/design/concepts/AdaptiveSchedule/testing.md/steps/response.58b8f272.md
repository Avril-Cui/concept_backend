# response:

You are absolutely correct. The TypeScript compiler is flagging these instances because `error` in a `catch` block is implicitly typed as `unknown` by default (a good safety measure introduced in newer TypeScript versions). To access properties like `.message`, TypeScript requires you to narrow down the type of `error`.

The most common and robust way to handle this is to check if `error` is an `instanceof Error` or to explicitly cast it to `any` (less safe, but quick for debugging) or `Error` (safer, assuming it's always an Error object). A good pattern is to convert `error` to a string:

```typescript
} catch (error: unknown) { // Explicitly declare 'error' as unknown
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  console.error(`Error in _getAdaptiveSchedule: ${errorMessage}`);
  return { error: `Failed to retrieve adaptive schedule: ${errorMessage}` };
}
```

I will apply this fix to all `catch` blocks in `src/concepts/AdaptiveSchedule/AdaptiveSchedule.ts`.
