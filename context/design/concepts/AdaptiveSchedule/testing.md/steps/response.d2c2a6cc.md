# response:

```typescript

/**
 * A mock implementation of GeminiLLM to control its response for deterministic testing.
 */
class MockGeminiLLM extends GeminiLLM {
    public mockResponse: string = '';
    constructor(config: GeminiConfig) {
        // Pass dummy config, as actual API calls are mocked
        super(config);
    }
    /**
     * Overrides the actual LLM execution to return a predefined mock response.
     */
    override async executeLLM(prompt: string): Promise<string> { // Added 'override' keyword here
        console.log(`  [MOCK LLM] Called with prompt (truncated): ${prompt.substring(0, 200)}...`);
        return Promise.resolve(this.mockResponse);
    }
}
// --- END MOCK GEMINILLM ---
```

**Reasoning for the fix:**

The TypeScript error `TS4114: This member must have an 'override' modifier because it overrides a member in the base class 'GeminiLLM'.` indicates that the `executeLLM` method in `MockGeminiLLM` is intended to override a method with the same name and signature in its parent class `GeminiLLM`.

TypeScript 4.3 introduced the `override` keyword to explicitly mark methods that are intended to override a base class method. This helps catch subtle bugs, like typos in method names, or when a base class method is renamed or removed, preventing accidental non-overrides.

By adding the `override` keyword to `async executeLLM(prompt: string): Promise<string>` in `MockGeminiLLM`, we explicitly state the intention to override the base class method, satisfying the TypeScript compiler's requirement and resolving the error.

No other files (such as `GeminiLLM.ts` or `AdaptiveSchedule.ts`) need modification, as the error specifically points to the `executeLLM` method within the `MockGeminiLLM` class in the test file.
