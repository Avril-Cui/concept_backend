# bad behavior

Although the code currently passed all test cases, the adaptive schedule is not behaving well. In particular:

```
All Tasks:

- Task ID: task:study, Name: Study for Exam, Priority: 1, Duration: 120 min, Splittable: true, Deadline: N/A

- Task ID: task:laundry, Name: Do Laundry, Priority: 3, Duration: 60 min, Splittable: false, Deadline: N/A

- Task ID: task:report, Name: Write Project Report, Priority: 2, Duration: 180 min, Splittable: true, Deadline: 2025-10-21T00:14:57.543Z

- Task ID: task:exercise, Name: Morning Exercise, Priority: 4, Duration: 30 min, Splittable: false, Deadline: N/A

  

Original Planned Schedule (as provided to LLM, if any):

(No planned schedule)

  

Actual Routine (as provided to LLM, if any):

(No actual routine)

  

Final Adaptive Schedule:

- Block ID: 0199f9d1-c26e-7f66-a91a-c3ade1b7d86f, Start: 2025-10-18T13:00:00.000Z, End: 2025-10-18T14:00:00.000Z, Tasks: []

- Block ID: 0199f9d1-c35e-7b44-bdcb-f9eae9632ccf, Start: 2025-10-19T01:00:00.000Z, End: 2025-10-19T02:00:00.000Z, Tasks: [task:report, task:laundry]

  

Final Dropped Tasks:

- Task ID: task:exercise, Reason: Insufficient time due to unexpected meeting.

```

You can see that the LLM schedule is not that smart because the time block "Block ID: 0199f9d1-c26e-7f66-a91a-c3ade1b7d86f, Start: 2025-10-18T13:00:00.000Z, End: 2025-10-18T14:00:00.000Z, Tasks: \[]" is empty, but the LLM dropped the task exercise.
Also, for the operational principle test case, I want there to be an original schedule and actual routine, so that there is not conflict. You should also log the current time, because the adaptive schedule should only schedule the unfinished tasks.
