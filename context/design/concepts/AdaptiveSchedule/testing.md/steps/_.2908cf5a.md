# Additional feature

* All test cases are passed now. However, I want to have a clearer view on what is going on. After each major test action, can you call the query getAdaptiveSchedule and log the current adaptive schedule? In addition to the logs you have now, I also want a summary log that logs:
  * All Tasks
  * The original Schedule
  * The actual Routine
  * The newest AdaptiveSchedule from querying getAdaptiveSchedule
