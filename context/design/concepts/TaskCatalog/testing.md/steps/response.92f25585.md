Okay, I understand. The previous `TaskCatalog.ts` implementation is correct, and the `principleUser` scope issue in the test file has been addressed. The current task is to refine the `TaskCatalog.test.ts` to meet the higher standards for test cases.

I will focus on:

1. Ensuring all assertions are programmatic.
2. Maintaining or enhancing informative console logs.
3. Implementing one dedicated "Operational Principle" trace.
4. Creating 3-5 distinct "Interesting Scenarios" to probe edge cases, undoing, repetition, and error handling.
5. Verifying that every action of the `TaskCatalog` concept is successfully executed in at least one test.
6. Strictly adhering to "no state setup except by calling concept actions."

Here is the updated `src/TaskCatalog/TaskCatalog.test.ts` with these improvements:
