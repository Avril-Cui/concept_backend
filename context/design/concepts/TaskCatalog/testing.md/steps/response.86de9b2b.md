# response:

You are absolutely right! This is a classic Deno permission error. Deno is secure by default and requires explicit permissions for tasks like reading files (like `.env`) or making network requests (to connect to MongoDB).

The error message: `NotCapable: Requires read access to ".env", run again with the --allow-read flag` tells you exactly what permission is missing.

To fix this, you need to add the necessary Deno permission flags to your test command. Based on the `deno.json` you provided earlier, you'll need `--allow-net` for database connection, `--allow-read` for the `.env` file and other potential file system operations, and `--allow-env` for reading environment variables.

**Solution:**

Execute your test command with the following flags:

```bash
deno test --allow-read --allow-net --allow-env src/concepts/TaskCatalog/TaskCatalog.test.ts
```

This command grants the required permissions for the test to run successfully. No changes are needed in your TypeScript files.
