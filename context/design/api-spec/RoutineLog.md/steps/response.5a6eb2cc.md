# response:

I apologize, but the content for `[@RoutineLog](../implementation/RoutineLog.md)` was not provided in your prompt. I need the actual TypeScript code for the `RoutineLogConcept` class to extract its API documentation according to the rules you've laid out.

Please provide the content of `RoutineLog.md` so I can proceed with the analysis and generate the API documentation.
