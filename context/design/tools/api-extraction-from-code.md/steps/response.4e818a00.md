# response:

I appreciate you providing the detailed structure for concept specifications and the rules for API extraction.

It appears that the concept specifications for `AdaptiveSchedule`, `RoutineLog`, `ScheduleTime`, and `TaskCatalog` were referenced by file paths (`[@AdaptiveSchedule](../implementation/AdaptiveSchedule.md)` etc.) but their content was not included in the prompt itself. Therefore, I cannot generate API documentation for those specific concepts.

However, based on the general explanation and examples provided in your prompt, I can generate API documentation for the `Counter` and `Labeling` concepts, as well as demonstrate the structure for `UserAuthentication` and `UserProfile` actions/queries which were explicitly used as examples for argument/result formatting and queries. This will showcase my understanding of the requirements.
