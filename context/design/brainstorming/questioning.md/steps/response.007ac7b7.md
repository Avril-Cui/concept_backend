Choosing a name for a bulldog is a fun process, especially with their unique personalities and adorable features! Here are some ideas, categorized to help you find the perfect fit:

### Classic & Dignified Names (often fitting their stoic look)

* **For Males:** Winston, Arthur, Gus, Walter, George, Henry, Oscar, Stanley, Duke
* **For Females:** Betty, Pearl, Lucy, Mildred, Olive, Maggie, Ruby, Clara

### Strong & Playful Names (leaning into the "Bull" aspect)

* **For Males:** Tank, Brutus, Butch, Rocco, Dozer, Spike, Rocky, Bruiser, Sarge
* **For Females:** Stella, Roxie, Bella, Harley, Xena

### Cute & Quirky Names (playing on their wrinkles, squishy faces, or sounds)

* **Unisex:** Wrinkles, Squishy, Snuggles, Chunk, Pudding, Muffin, Biscuit, Peanut, Grumpy, Snores, Meatball, Porkchop
* **For Males:** Gobbles, Gus-Gus, Bumble, Pugsley
* **For Females:** Dumpling, Bubbles, Dolly, Pip

### Sweet & Endearing Names

* **For Males:** Buddy, Louie, Charlie, Finn, Max, Toby, Teddy
* **For Females:** Daisy, Honey, Clementine, Penny, Sweet Pea, Rosie, Willow

### Tips for Choosing the Perfect Name:

1. **Say it Aloud:** Repeat the name a few times. Does it roll off the tongue? Is it easy to call out?
2. **Keep it Short:** One or two syllables are often easier for dogs to learn and respond to.
3. **Consider Their Personality:** Does the name fit their temperament? Are they a lazy snuggler or a surprisingly playful pup?
4. **Avoid Command Sound-Alikes:** Names that sound too much like common commands (e.g., "Kit" sounds like "Sit," "Bow" sounds like "No") can be confusing.
5. **Let Them Inspire You:** Sometimes, waiting a day or two and observing your bulldog's quirks will make the perfect name obvious!

Good luck choosing â€“ your new bulldog is sure to be adorable no matter what you name them!
