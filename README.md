# Source code for implementation and testing
# Updated design
See my updates for my concept design here: `/design/results/design2.md`

## `/src/concepts/`
Contains the implementation of four core concepts:
- **TaskCatalog**: Manages tasks with dependencies, priorities, deadlines, and scheduling
- **ScheduleTime**: Handles time block creation and task assignment to planned schedules
- **RoutineLog**: Records actual session activities and routine tracking
- **AdaptiveSchedule**: AI-powered adaptive scheduling that adjusts plans based on actual routine deviations

Each concept includes:
- Implementation file (`.ts`)
- Comprehensive test suite (`.test.ts`). A more designed explanation on these test cases can be found in `/design/results/ConsoleOutput.md`.

### `/src/utils/`
Shared utilities:
- **database.ts**: MongoDB connection management and test database utilities
- **types.ts**: Common type definitions (ID, Empty, etc.)
- **GeminiLLM.ts**: Integration with Google's Gemini AI for adaptive scheduling

# Markdown design files for concept specifications

## `/design/`
Complete design documentation including concept specifications, implementation notes, testing strategies, and design exploration materials. Interacts with the Context Tool.

### `/design/concepts` key files
Contains my finalized concept specifications and conversations with the Context Tool to generate implementation and test cases. In particular, for each of the four core concepts (i.e., TaskCatalog, ScheduleTime, RoutineLog, AdaptiveSchedule), there are a set of files:
- **`[ConceptName].md`:** contains the finalized concept specification
	- [TaskCatalog](design/concepts/TaskCatalog/TaskCatalog.md)
	- [ScheduleTime](design/concepts/ScheduleTime/ScheduleTime.md)
	- [RoutineLog](design/concepts/RoutineLog/RoutineLog.md)
	- [AdaptiveSchedule](design/concepts/AdaptiveSchedule/AdaptiveSchedule.md)
- **`implementation.md`:**: contains the Context Tool implementation of the concept
	- [TaskCatalog implementation](design/concepts/TaskCatalog/implementation.md)
	- [ScheduleTime implementation](design/concepts/ScheduleTime/implementation.md)
	- [RoutineLog implementation](design/concepts/RoutineLog/implementation.md)
	- [AdaptiveSchedule implementation](design/concepts/AdaptiveSchedule/implementation.md)
- **`testing.md`:**: contains conversation with the Context Tool to generate test cases
	- [TaskCatalog testing](design/concepts/TaskCatalog/testing.md)
	- [ScheduleTime testing](design/concepts/ScheduleTime/testing.md)
	- [RoutineLog testing](design/concepts/RoutineLog/testing.md)
	- [AdaptiveSchedule testing](design/concepts/AdaptiveSchedule/testing.md)

# Result write up: test results, concepts and design updates, interesting moments
## `/design/results/ConsoleOutput.md`
Contains a copy of the console output showing the execution of the test script for each concept (in markdown).
[ConsoleOutput](design/results/ConsoleOutput.md)

## `/design/results/design.md`
A design file explaining changes I made to the concept and application designs as specified in Assignment 2 and any other issues that came up (in markdown). Also records interesting moments with explanation and links to relevant files.

# `/context`
Snapshots that confirm that I worked in a reflective and incremental way.
I didn't save intermediate snapshots of Typescript files because I thought ctx is used for markdown and tracking design progress. However, intermediate versions of my Typescript implementation can be found in these design implementation snapshots in the context section. I also took a snapshot of the final version of code,

## Running Tests
- Since one of my concepts is AI-augmented, some times that specific test case might fail. But you can run deno test again, and it's very likely all will pass.
```bash
deno test -A
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with:
  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=
  GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
  GEMINI_CONFIG=./geminiConfig.json
  MONGODB_URL=
  DB_NAME=
   ```

2. Install Deno: https://deno.land/

3. Run tests to verify setup:
   ```bash
   deno test -A
   ```
